<article class="post">
I'm a webdeveloper currently living in Denmark. 
My main focus is on extending the functionality of internet and intranet systems. 
I have extensive experience with creating such extensions, both in the form of web services, libraries, usercontrols and webparts.

<h3>Short bio:</h3>
I was born in Flensburg, Germany and I have lived there for 20 years.
I later moved to Aarhus in Denmark in order to study Physics and IT.
Later I decided to focus on IT. I got my degree and I now work in small IT firm as a webdeveloper.
