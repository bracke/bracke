title: Blogging with my iPhone

I would like to use my iPhone to blog to maximize the chances of any blogging actually happening! There are many blogging Apps in the AppStore, but they all seem to have the same (very) basic feature set.

### Blog features - no markup
They all allow you to enter text and to add an image. Some also allow links, tags and smilies. But none of them support basic text markup like bold or italics! I currently use BlogPress and this app also has this shortcoming.

### Crucial?
Obviously this is not crucial and certainly not enough to prevent the use of these blogging apps. It is strange though and I certainly would like to be able to mark text. If there was a blogging app with this feature I would buy it.

Maybe the coming Squarespace app or the MacJournal Touch app will support this when they arrive. One can hope.
