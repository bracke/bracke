I have for quite a while been hosting my homepage (the one you are looking at!) on my own server at home, a MacMini. I have now finally moved the site to GitHub.

<h3>The Process</h3>
The site is still created as a series of static pages by jekyll, a static site generator. I use a slightly modified version of Jekyll and a bunch of extensions.<br><br>


The following assumes that you have registered on GitHub and created a repository for your site. Clone this repository using GIT or the GitHub app.
<ul>

    <li>Open a command line and make the local site directory the current directory.</li>
    <li>Run the jekyll instruction which creates the static site.</li>
    <li>Copy the resulting files into the cloned repository.</li>
    <li>Commit the changes and push/sync them to the gh-pages branch using GIT or the GitHub app.</li>

</ul>
<br>
I have pointed my DNS to the GitHub ip address and added a CNAME file to the website root, which contains a single line: "bracke.dk" (my domain).<br><br>
The website is pushed to the gh-pages branch of repository and that branch is set as the default branch (look at the "Admin" section of your site on GitHub).
<br><br>
The above was not obvious to me and I found the documentation on GitHub quite confusing on this matter.
