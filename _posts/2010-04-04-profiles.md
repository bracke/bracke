I have several profile pages on the web. It seems every site on the web requires you to enter all sorts of private information and many publish this data as a user profile. I usually only enter what is necessary  or required and I try to activate all privacy options.

<h3>Limiting profiles</h3>
There are a few exceptions though. I  like the idea of having a public profile on which I present myself and my qualifications. But I would like to limit the number of profiles so that&#8217;s it easier to keep them up to date.</p>

<h3>LinkedIn and others</h3>
I have chosen LinkedIn as my main public profile but I have also a Facebook page as the seems to be no way to avoid it. I also have profiles on Savannah and Sourceforge since I have projects registered there.</p>

<p>I have now updated those 4 pages and hope to keep them updated from now on. I have placed links to my profile pages in the  right column. More will inevitably follow.</p>
