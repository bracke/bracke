It seems typography is the latest and greatest among web designers. All web designers blog about it and magazines write about it. It&#8217;s almost as if it was a new thing. It not new and has in fact been known and used for a very, very long time. <!--more-->But on the web it has seen very little attention. On most webpages choosing between two web safe fonts is the height of typography.

<h3>Much-needed Focus on Typography</h3>
I think a renewed focus on typography is very much-needed. I have myself never really given it much thought and this webpage has very much been a victim of that. I will therefore use bracke.dk as my platform for experimenting with typography.</p>

<h3>Basic Things</h3>
For now I have changed a few basic things and I will check these changes over next few weeks and possibly tweak them further.
<ul>
<li>Serif font &#8220;Georgia&#8221;</li>
<li>Indented first line  (css: <code>text-indent:50px;</code>)</li>
<li>Large first letter (css: <code>p:first-letter { font-size: 1.8em; }</code>)</li>
<li>Quoted text in small caps (css: <code>quote { font-variant: small-caps; }</code>)</li>
</ul>
