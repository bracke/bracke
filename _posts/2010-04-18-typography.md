It seems typography is the latest and greatest among web designers. All web designers blog about it and magazines write about it. It&#8217;s almost as if it was a new thing. It not new and has in fact been known and used for a very, very long time.

But on the web it has seen very little attention. On most webpages choosing between two web safe fonts is the height of typography.

### Much-needed Focus on Typography
I think a renewed focus on typography is very much-needed. I have myself never really given it much thought and this webpage has very much been a victim of that. I will therefore use bracke.dk as my platform for experimenting with typography.

### Basic Things
For now I have changed a few basic things and I will check these changes over next few weeks and possibly tweak them further.

- Serif font &#8220;Georgia&#8221;
- Indented first line  (css: <code>text-indent:50px;</code>)
- Large first letter (css: <code>p:first-letter { font-size: 1.8em; }</code>)
- Quoted text in small caps (css: <code>quote { font-variant: small-caps; }</code>)
