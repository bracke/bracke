title: Command &amp; Conquer 4 vs. MacMini and Paralells
category: gaming
---
My main computer at home is a MacMini (current gen.) which is a very nice machine but probably never meant as gaming machine. Nevertheless I decided to try running C&amp;C 4 on it using Parallels.

<h3>It works!</h3>
Surprisingly it seems to work very well. The game runs without a hitch, except for the music which sometimes does skip a bit or two.</p>

<p>Note: I have lowered the graphics setting and I have not played the game much. Perhaps later and more complex parts of the game, have greater requirements.</p>

<h3>Waiting for Red Alert 4</h3>
This is actually the first time I&#8217;m playing a game in the original Command &amp; Conquer series. I have however played both Red Alert 2, Red Alert 3 and Command &amp; Conquer: Generals.</p>

<p>I like playing it, but I would prefer playing Red Alert 4, which hopefully is on its way!</p>
