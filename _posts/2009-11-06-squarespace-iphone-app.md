Squarespace has just released their iPhone app. The app is free and only connects to Squarespace accounts.

<h3>Great GUI - no special features</h3>
Featurewise it is very much like many other blogging apps. It supports editing of new and existing blog posts and supports images and tagging. It does not offer any support for markup of text.<br/> Where the Squarespace app is different is the GUI and statistics. The GUI is very smooth and intuitive and the statistics are very nice, although also very depressing regarding my site.</p>

<p>I hope more features will be added soon, it is the nicest blogging application I have tried yet and it&#8217;s what I have used to write this post.</p>
