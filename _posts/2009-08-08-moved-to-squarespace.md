I have recently moved my website to Squarespace and also chosen to use my Squarespace site as my blog. My old Blogspot blog is no more. Though I have managed to import the two (!) poultry blog entries from that blog into Squarespace.

### Import / Export
That  import function and the corresponding export function are very nice and make switching to Squarespace (and from)  much easier. Although I probably would have survived having to add those two entries myself.

### iPhone App
So far I am&nbsp;very satisfied with Squarespace. I do miss the promised iPhone app. It would be very useful to be able to change my Squarespace with a dedicated app. Using  the Squarespace website with Mobile Safari for that task is a bit cumbersome.
